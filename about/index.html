      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <h2 class="centered gold">Why BEATS BY CAYDE?</h2>
      <p class="white type-big">BEATS BY CAYDE is a growing, mid-sized clan with a healthy active roster full of people who <em>still enjoy this game</em>. Our goal is to make friends and help others enjoy this game too.</p>
      <p class="white type-big">Our members are strong players, but we're not gods. That means that you don't have to be a god to join (but if you are, <em>awesome</em>), but we are not a carry clan.</p>
      <p class="white type-big">As space becomes more limited on our roster, we have decided to focus our recruitment efforts on players whose accomplishments reflect the passion for the game we're looking for. Starting in Season 3, BEATS BY CAYDE has implemented base statistical criteria for <a href="/apply/" title="View application requirements">admission</a>.</p>
