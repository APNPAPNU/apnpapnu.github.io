By request, I've revived the change log. I'm going to take a more structured–dare I say professional–approach to writing it.\n\nRecently, I posted again to Reddit, and the overwhelming feedback received was that I switch to using an OAuth model where users can authenticate with Bungie. The primary reason for this request, being asked to select your character on each subsequent visit, can be solved without OAuth. Other indirect requests for OAuth include the ability to see ones currencies and other class specific items on the Vendors page. I have failed to explain to users that the Vendors endpoint actually requires OAuth, and when they view them on Braytech, they're actually viewing them from the perspective of my own character (Warlock).\n\nWhile I have reached a level of skill where I could dare to try integrating OAuth, it's not without its cons i.e. quickly and easily looking up another player. You could argue that I could integrate it side by side with my current lookup mechanism... But I don't want to.\n\nLeading up to Christmas, I had completely lost myself in working on this site. It's easy to lose perspective as you bury yourself in feature after feature, especially of your over-arching goal.\n\nI'm not trying to build a DIM competitor or replace similar sites. Braytech is a learning exercise and something that I too want to enjoy using. A convenient and semi-beautiful tool to aid in my Destiny obsession.\n\nIt started as a Xur location/sales tracker. Then I took on some checklists. And now... Well it's a bit of everything, now...\n        "

It's been a long time coming because I've never used ServiceWorkers before. I keep typing ServiceWalkers instead of ServiceWorkers which I find super strange.\n\nAnyway, the basic idea–as far as I understand it–behind ServiceWorkers is that they run behind the code that actually drives Braytech or other sites and apps. They silently perform tasks in the background like checking for new code. When they find new code, they tell the browser, and the next time the users visits–after closing all tabs of the site–the browser installs and runs the new code.\n\nLots of fun capabilities come with ServiceWorkers, like making web apps feel more like offline native apps. The reason I use them is for how effectively they cache frequently used assets. Subsequent visits to Braytech load instantly. We all like this.\n"

Read about it below.\n- Made inline nav improvements for smaller viewports\n- Added 'rare collectibles' to Account view\n\n## Conversation\nSo, why the heck did you remove the Vendors page!\n- it was a reflection of my personal vendor data meaning my Destiny progression affects what it displays. Normally, Vendors are hidden behind OAuth–the funky click to login with Bungie buttons–which Braytech doesn’t use. More on this in a tick\n- only a small fraction of users actually used it\n\nSo, why doesn’t Braytech use OAuth then? A few reasons. \n- I’ve always wanted Braytech to be as accessible as possible. Requiring users to authenticate hampers that. OAuth is required for things like inventory actions. That market is very well-filled by DIM, Ishtar Commander, and at least 5 other apps\n- it’d be a fair bit of work to implement and as Braytech is a hobby and hobbies are meant to be fun...\n- why don’t you just have both options?\n\nThe good news? I haven't nuked the page entirely. You can still access it at braytech.org/vendors.\n\nThe final change in this minor update is an improvement to the Account view. I've added 'rare collectibles' allowing you to see, at a glance, if a player is good or not. A joke. I'll be adding more modules over time, as I think of them."

Membership IDs are now all over the app's URLs so you can easily share your view with a fellow Guardian and vice versa.\n\nPreviously, you might access: `https://braytech.org/triumphs/3685363199/2993089843/231845845/3324094091`. This URL doesn't contain any player context. You can still share a URL like this one to direct others to your view, but if you want to brag, you'd share a URL like: `https://braytech.org/1/4611686018449662397/2305843009260574394/triumphs/3685363199/2993089843/231845845/3324094091`.\n\nThis was an incredibly great undertaking and I was aided by Michael Pearson in its implementation. Braytech does a lot of stuff under the hood to try and be smarter and improve the user's experience. Examples include, remembering your profile and automatically loading it as soon as possible upon you opening the app. Coupled with the changes to URLs, this sort of thing is complicated and requires very thorough testing.\n\nIn addition to loading your profile ASAP, it also refreshes your profile data every 60 seconds in the background - another layer of complexity.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nTom, why are Vendors gone... So, I like to do few things excellently, rather than lots of things forgettably. I believe most of you feel the same way. DIM, the official Companion app, and others already handle vendors. I don't need to try and compete with them. Braytech isn't an item manager!\n\nOn the technical side, vendor data requires OAuth to access - you know, when a web site sends you to Bungie.net to authorise access for their app - and Braytech stears clear of that complexity. The vendor data I was making available was a cached reflection of my own character's. So as I collected items, etc., they'd suddenly disappear from Braytech's view. Additionally, some vendors sell class-specific items - I couldn't show you the correct gear... Unless you're a Warlock of course.\n\nI get a lot of a questions about clan stats. Here's the thing... clan stats were drawn from a particular part of Destiny's API that is often unreliable. I had far too many players come and tell me they've done far many more than 0 Nightfalls. You can see where this is going... Additionally, with this major update, it became infeasible to maintain the messy code that I wrote to drive it. I'd need to start from scratch. While we're on the topic of clan stats, certain stats in the roster view are drawn from the same source and therefore are unreliable and may be on the chopping block."
