      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <h2 class="centered gold">Why Λscendant?</h2>
      <p class="white type-big">Λscendant is a growing, mid-sized clan with a healthy active roster full of people who <em>still enjoy this game</em>. Our goal is to make friends and help others enjoy this game too.</p>
      <p class="white type-big">Our members are strong players, but we're not gods. That means that you don't have to be a god to join (but if you are, <em>awesome</em>), but we are not a carry clan.</p>
      <p class="white type-big">As space becomes more limited on our roster, we have decided to focus our recruitment efforts on players whose accomplishments reflect the passion for the game we're looking for. Starting in Season 3, Λscendant has implemented base statistical criteria for <a href="/apply/" title="View application requirements">admission</a>.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-section--content" style="display: none;">
          <!-- <p>Currently, there are four ranks in Λscendant: <strong>Initiate</strong>, <strong>Honored</strong>, <strong>Revered</strong>, and <strong>Λscendant</strong>.</p>
          <h4>Initiate <span style="display: inline-block; height: 10px; width: 10px; border-radius: 50%; background: #72c173; margin-left: .6rem; vertical-align: middle;"></span></h4>
          <p>Initiate is the entry level clan rank. Initiates are active members who are here to hang out, have fun, and make friends while working on getting better and reaching higher clan ranks.</p>
          <h4>Honored <span style="display: inline-block; height: 10px; width: 10px; border-radius: 50%; background: #6cbdd1; margin-left: .6rem; vertical-align: middle;"></span></h4>
          <p>Honored are guardians a cut above, with the stats to show for it. Honored guardians have a <strong>PvP K/D</strong> of <strong>1.0</strong> or better, <strong style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333; cursor: help" title="(Kills + (Assists/2))/Deaths">KDA of 1.25</strong> or better, an <strong>efficiency of 1.50</strong> or better, <em>or</em> a <strong>Strike/Raid average K/D of 17.5</strong> or better.</p>

          <p>Dedicated Guardians, masters of raids, and demons in the Crucible. Hand picked from Λscendant's upper ranks, Λscendant is a brother clan to Λscendant, meant to serve its most skilled and committed warriors, who act as mentors to the Revered, Honored, and Initiate members.</p> -->
